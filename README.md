    <strong><i>A feature-rich Modmail bot for Discord.</i></strong>

## What is Modmail?

Modmail is similar to Reddit's Modmail, both in functionality and purpose. It serves as a shared inbox for server staff to communicate with their users in a seamless way.

This bot is free for everyone and always will be. If you like this project and would like to show your appreciation, you can support us on **[Patreon](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=888281596396982312&permissions=8&scope=bot)**, cool benefits included!

## How does it work?

When a member sends a direct message to the bot, Modmail will create a channel or "thread" into a designated category. All further DM messages will automatically relay to that channel; any available staff can respond within the *channel.*
